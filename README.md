# HO3V: The Dataset for Arbitrary View Action Recognition via Transfer Dictionary Learning on Synthetic Training Data

![teaser](https://github.com/hubertshum/HO3V/blob/e2d7b608af45505f70d4256eb8fa88f7dcdb2fc0/teaser.png)

<p>We present the HO3V datasets for arbitrary view action recognition, as described in the paper <a href="http://hubertshum.com/pbl_icra2016action.htm">Arbitrary View Action Recognition via Transfer Dictionary Learning on Synthetic Training Data</a>. HO3V includes 2 sub-datasets tailored for N-UCLA and IXMAS, each consisting of a set of AVI videos and BVH motion files.

The AVI video files can be viewed by a video player. The BVH motion data can be visualised using Autodesk MotionBuilder. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtv0q3KQ5a9rKTl3v4qwmTY2VaXemwPu8">YouTube tutorials</a> are available.
